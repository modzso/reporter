description: BIG COMPANY is employing a lot of employees. Company would like to analyze its organizational structure and identify potential improvements. Board wants to make sure that every manager earns at least 20% more than the average salary of its direct subordinates, but no more than 50% more than that average. Company wants to avoid too long reporting lines, therefore we would like to identify all employees which have more than 4 managers between them and the CEO.

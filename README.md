# Requirements

* Java 21
* Maven 3+

# Compiling

`mvn clean install`

# Running

`java -jar target/reporter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar employee.csv`

# Documentation

Javadoc can be generated by:
`mvn javadoc:javadoc`
The generated documentation can be found in target/site/apidocs

# Assumptions

* The program exits if no file is specified in the command line
* Header is present, and the order of columns is always the same:
`Id,firstName,lastName,salary,managerId`
where the managerId is optional
* The program throws an exception if there are more than one employee without manager.
* The program throws an exception if there are no CEO (without managerId).
* The program does not check for circular connection that is A is manager of B, B is manager of C, and C is manager of A.

# Design
* Employee class stores the parsed data. Because the manager and subordinates are set later, I opted to use a normal class instead of record.
* CsvParser handles the parsing of the input data. It returns a map of Employees, where all properties are already set.
* Reporter creates the report. It receives the map of Employees, executes multiple checks (Is there a CEO?, are there multiple CEOs?) If these checks don't fail, creates the report.
* ReporterApplication is the mail class, it is checking the program arguments, and prints the report to the standard output.
